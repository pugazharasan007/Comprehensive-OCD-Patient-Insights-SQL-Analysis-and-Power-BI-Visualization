# Comprehensive-OCD-Patient-Insights-SQL-Analysis-and-Power-BI-Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of an OCD patient dataset consisting of 1,500 patients. The project involves SQL-based data analysis and Power BI visualizations to provide comprehensive insights into OCD diagnosis, symptom duration, and treatment trends.

## Project Components
**1. SQL Analysis**
SQL queries were used to extract and transform data from a PostgreSQL database. The analysis includes:
* Gender Distribution: Analyzed the proportion of male and female patients.
* Average Age: Calculated the average age of patients.
* Ethnicity and Obsession Scores: Examined the average obsession scores by ethnicity.
* Monthly Diagnosis Trends: Tracked the number of diagnoses per month.
* Symptom Duration: Calculated the average duration of symptoms.
* Family History of OCD: Analyzed the prevalence of family history among patients.
* Comorbidity: Identified patients diagnosed with both depression and anxiety.
* Obsession and Compulsion Types: Evaluated the most common types and their severity.

**2. Power BI Visualizations**
The insights from SQL queries were visualized using Power BI, creating two main dashboards:

*Dashboard 1: Demographic and Clinical Overview*

* Gender Distribution: Donut Chart
* Average Age: Card Visualization
* Patients by Ethnicity and Obsession Score: Clustered Bar Chart
* Number of People Diagnosed with OCD Month-over-Month: Line Chart
* Average Duration of Symptoms: Card Visualization or Gauge Chart
* Patients with Family History of OCD: Stacked Bar Chart
* Count of Patients with Both Depression and Anxiety: Card Visualization
  
*Dashboard 2: Obsession, Compulsion, and Educational/Marital Status Insights*

* Symptom Severity Based on Age: Stacked Column Chart
* Education Level Distribution: Pie Chart
* Most Common Obsession and Compulsion Types & Their Respective Average Obsession Scores: Clustered Column Charts

* Patient ID
